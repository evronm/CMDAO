Here's my preliminary take:

# The DAO 
- primary purpose is in-person events.  Virtual events can happen as well, but it's a minor thing.  
    - Also, the primary in-person events are the weekly meetups, but we want presence at many conferences, and possibly, eventually, a conference of our own.

- The DAO will be international, handling global issues, with sub-daos (metadaos?) for some of the local chapters.
  - The treasury will be international, with regular and one time payments going to local sub-dao's, and also regular and one-time payments to outside vendors (e.g. meetup.com).  We will need to decide on a currency for the treasury.
  - Changes in regular payments, and all one time payments, must be approved by a vote.
  - There needs to be some kind of procedure for calling a vote.  This could turn out to be quite tricky, especially if we adopt my voting market idea listed below.
  - Votes can be about literally anything, but will mostly involve token minting and expeditures.

# Token Structure
- Three types of tokens:
  - "Soulbound" nontransferrable information about each members.  These needn't really be tokens, and the attestation system I'm building could end up being a good base for this.  It's just about keeping track of members' contributions, as attested to by other members.  We may require a subset of users authorized to make such attestations, or some system to discourage false attestations.
  - Fungible "value" tokens.  These should be exchangeable for swag (and ideally drinks and food at the hosting venue, but that will take some doing), and transferable like any other token.  They should be awarded on a regular basis based on a score calculated from the "souldbound" info.  Something along the lines of "attend a meetup=3 token; host a meetup=5 tokens; filma meetup=10 tokens," etc.
  - Voting tokens:  These should be issued to value token holders, either on a 1 for 1 basis, or using some kind of formula.  Each token is good for 1 vote.  How these votes are run is up for debate, but I favor a vote market system, in which these tokens can be bought and sold until the actual vote, at which time they become worthless.  Other systems to consider:  quadratic voting and straight 1 token=1 vote.


# Establishing rules/bylaws
- These should, of course, be handled by votes, but I think there should be special votes for these kinds of things.  We can also have several "levels" of rules, requiring differnt majorities to pass.  
- We will need to come up with some kind of format for these things, as they will be voted on and acted on verbatim.  We need a way to minimize ambiguity.  This one will be quite tricky as well, but we can look to other DAO's for inspiration.
- The most important thing to estalish early is basic standards for being a CM chapter.  I expect there to be a large variety of opinions on this, but we're all about consensus :D.
- There needs to be a way to sync/harmonize all of this with the legal structure.
